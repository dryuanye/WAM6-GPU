# WAM6-GPU
GPU-accelerated global spectral ocean wave model.

The code package is accelerated by OpenACC based on the WAM6, a third-generation spectral ocean wave model extensively used across EU states.
The original source code is maintained by Dr. Arno Behrens (Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon).
Please refer to https://github.com/mywave/WAM for technical manual, usage and compiling instructions.
The OpenACC version is accomplished by Dr. Ye Yuan at NMEFC CHINA. Journal paper is under preparation.
